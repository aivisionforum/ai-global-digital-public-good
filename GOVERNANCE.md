# Governance Model

The AI Global Digital Public Good Working Group operates under open collaboration principles.

## Roles
- Maintainers: Oversee repository content and structure.
- Contributors: Submit documents, reports, and discussions via Pull Requests.
- Reviewers: Provide peer review and quality checks on submissions.

## Decision Process
- Consensus is preferred for decisions.
- If consensus cannot be reached, maintainers may facilitate a vote or escalate to a neutral steering committee.
- All decisions and updates are documented transparently within GitHub Issues or Discussions.

## Alignment
This working group aligns with the goals of international open collaboration and digital public goods development.
