*Advancing Open, Inclusive, and Sustainable AI for Humanity*  

---

## About This Repository  
This repository hosts the activities and outputs of the **AI for Global Digital Public Good (AI4GDPG) Working Group**.  The group focuses on how **AI can serve as a global digital public good**, ensuring that the benefits of artificial intelligence are shared equitably across all societies.  

The working group adheres to the **open source spirit** — promoting transparency, inclusivity, and global collaboration in AI development and governance.  

---

## Mission  
To explore and advance the design, development, and governance of **AI as a Global Digital Public Good (GDPG)** through open collaboration, ethical practices, and international cooperation.  

---

## Key Focus Areas  

### 1. UNs Global Digital Compact & AI  
- Building on the UNs **Global Digital Compact**, which aims to:  
  - Bridge digital divides  
  - Promote open, secure, and inclusive digital spaces  
  - Govern AI responsibly in line with the **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**  
- Promote **digital public goods (DPGs)** such as open source software, open data, open models, open standards, and open content.  

---

### 2. Requirements for AI as a Public Good  
- Must be **non-excludable** and **non-rivalrous** — accessible to all and not diminished by use.  
- Shared under **open, transparent licenses**.  
- Provenance of data clearly documented.  
- Accessible compute infrastructure to ensure broad participation.  

---

### 3. Overcoming Barriers  
- **Financial barriers** — high costs for developing and maintaining AI systems.  
- **Accessibility barriers** — limited technical, linguistic, or infrastructure access.  
- **Participation barriers** — lack of diversity and representation in AI development.  
- **Governance fragmentation** — lack of coordinated global frameworks.  

---

### 4. Building Strong Foundations  
- **Compute Support**: Democratize access to compute through national supercomputing centers and cloud partnerships.  
- **Capacity Building**: Training that includes technical, ethical, and governance skills.  
- **Public-Private Partnerships**: Combine innovation with accountability through neutral, multilateral cooperation.  

---

### 5. Implementation & Best Practices  
- **UNICC AI Hub**: Expertise and shared infrastructure for global AI initiatives.  
- **AI Sandbox**: Testing environments and collaborative tools.  
- **AI Academy**: Upskilling and reskilling programs for AI readiness.  

---

### 6. Open Source as an Enabler  
- Reduces cost and distribution barriers.  
- Empowers developing nations to leapfrog AI infrastructure limitations.  
- Enhances safety and reliability through open peer review and transparency.

## Planned Deliverables  
The AI4GDPG Working Group aims to produce:  
- **White Papers & Reports**: On AI public good frameworks and governance models.  
- **Guidelines & Frameworks**: Practical steps for building open AI ecosystems.  
- **Collection of Best Practices**: Case studies of AI DPG implementations.  
- **Open Datasets & Tools**: For collaborative development and testing.  
- **Policy Contributions**: Input into UN, national, and regional digital cooperation agendas.  

---

## Community Activities  
- **Strategy & Research**: Frameworks, standards, and collaborative studies.  
- **Collaboration**: Joint projects with open source communities and international partners.  
- **News & Scanning**: Regular updates on global developments in AI and DPGs.
